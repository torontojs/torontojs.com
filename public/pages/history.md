# Toronto JS Folklore

2010 - [Taz Singh](https://twitter.com/tazsingh) started Toronto JavaScript as it‚Äôs known today back in 2010 in order to get folks together to talk about the JavaScript applications they were building. He hosted socials & tech talks initially.

Taz worked with [Dann Toliver](https://danntoliver.com/) to bring JS Workshops into TorontoJS. "JS Workshop" has probably run longer than Toronto JS.

Around 2014, [(Matthew) Mihok](https://twitter.com/matthewmihok) volunteered to help.
He further consolidated [Paul Dowman](https://www.pauldowman.com/)‚Äôs Code Club events into TorontoJS, so we can all together focus our energy towards a common goal - Toronto & Canadian JavaScript communities at large.

Paul Dowman's JS Code Club joins TorontoJS, and Paul joins the Organizers. Paul also created an agency called OKGrow. As a way of building rapport, he created JS Code Club.

2015 - Taz moves away to UK, stays as Ambassador for TorontoJS in the UK.

Taz shuts down the TorontoJS Inc. Corporation and Paul, Dann, Mihok recreate it as a non-profit corporation, with each listed as a Director officially.

2016 - Taz, Dann, Paul, Mihok are Organizers and Directors.
Paul joins Shopify and leaves TorontoJS as an Organizer, is removed from the corporations Director role.

2019 - Mihok takes over majority of planning and execution of events and has been running TorontoJS alone for 2 years, with Dann acting as an advisor.

[Simon Stern](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-stern-2a04538b) and [Alex Wilmer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-wilmer/) help with hosting some events.

[Sherry Yang](https://5hel2l2y.github.io/) starts volunteering with TJS. In a bid to be more inclusive and make don't only drink beer, renames "BeerScript" to ‚ÄúJS Social‚Äù.

Here and there, [Evert Pot](https://evertpot.com/) and [Nicole Chung](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicole-chung-6b06b33/) give talks and workshops.

[Rohan Nair](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohannair10/) emerges now and then to grouch at how the community is growing so large no one wants to do startups anymore.

2020 - [Sherry Yang](https://5hel2l2y.github.io/) moves out to Calgary ü•≤ and continues helping with hosting and facilitating from a distance!

[Jen Chan](https://jenchan.biz/) starts as an overenthusiastic moderator, and grows out a mod team of admins and investigators. Jen helps waves of bootcamp grads and self taught people find jobs. We all start volunteering together.

Meanwhile, Evert and Nicole continue to give talks and workshops.

Covid happens; all gatherings move online. More scams and grifts flood the Slack channel which Jen, Chris Naismith, Kieran, Erik keep working hard to weed out.

2021 - Jen joins Mihok as an Organizer, rolls out a [Code of Conduct](https://torontojs.com/p/code_of_conduct) and volunteer program.

2022 - Sherry Yang joins as Organizer and invites more people to be part of organizing events!

The volunteer program has since scaled 3 times.

2023 - Chris Naismith joins (and departs) as Organizer, [Yuri Yang](https://yuriyang.com) and [Danny Kim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/0916dhkim/) join as event organizers!

Evert starts TL;DR an [infrequent newsletter](https://tldr.torontojs.com/). [Ken Beaudin](https://www.biodrop.io/kbventures) starts coordinating promotion.

[Marco Campos](https://madcampos.dev/) and [Dale Karp](https://dale.io/) join to run JS Code Club.
